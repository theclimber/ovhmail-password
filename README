This is a small script to setup on your OVH mutualisated server to manage email passwords

To install, follow the following steps :
1) create a config.php file. Copy the config_sample.php file to config.php and edit the file to set your OVH nic-handle and you password. The file should look like this :
<?php
$applicationKey    = 'xxxxx';  // Application Key
$applicationSecret = 'xxxxxx'; // Application Secret
$consumerKey       = 'xxxxxx'; // Consumer Key
$ovhEndpoint = 'ovh-eu';       // Endpoint of API OVH Europe
$domain = "yourdomain.tld"; // your domain name
$serveur="pop3.". $domain;
$dom = "@". $domain;

2) run `composer install` to get dependancies (OVH API files)

3) just copy all the files in a folder of your mutualisated server. For example :
mail/common.css
mail/config.php
mail/config_sample.php
mail/index.php
mail/logo.jpg
mail/README
mail/vendor/

3) surf with your prefered navigator to yourdomain.tld/mail

That's it ! Have fun
